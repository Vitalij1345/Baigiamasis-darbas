This code is a password generator application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to generate random passwords based on their preferences. The application provides the following functionality:

Password Generation: Users can specify the length of the password and select which character types to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). The application then generates a random password based
on these criteria.

Multiple Password Generation: Users can generate multiple passwords at once by specifying the number of passwords they want. The passwords are generated using the same criteria as mentioned above.

View Passwords: Users have the option to view the generated passwords in the application. The passwords are displayed in a scrolled text area, where each password is listed with its corresponding index number.

Clear Passwords: Users can clear the generated passwords from the application. This removes all the passwords from the scrolled text area.

Save Passwords to File: Users can save the generated passwords to a text file. The application prompts the user to choose a file name and location to save the passwords. The passwords are written to the file with their
corresponding index numbers.

The application also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with various elements such as labels, entry fields, checkboxes, buttons, and a scrolled text area. The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with
the password generator functionality.
